## About The Project

<img src="https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/cdp/cf/ul/g/3a/b8/ICLH_Diagram_Batch_01_03-DeepNeuralNetwork.png" width="720" height="330">om)

The realm of League of Legends is vast and complex, with champions that fit into specific archetypes, each with their own strengths and roles in battle. ChampNet is a deep learning model designed to classify these champions based on their archetypes using neural networks. By analyzing champion images, ChampNet can accurately assign one of the six archetypes: Marksman, Mage, Tank, Assassin, Fighter, and Support, providing insights for strategic gameplay and team composition.

The project includes a comprehensive dataset preprocessing pipeline, a neural network model built with Keras, and a testing suite to evaluate the model's accuracy.

### Built With

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

List of things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* Python
  ```sh
  python --version
  Python 3.8.5

### Installation

To set up ChampNet for use or development, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wburayu/ChampNet.git



## Usage

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ChampNet

3.Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

4. Open the .ipynb notebook files within the Jupyter interface in your browser.

Run the cells in the notebook to see the process in action. You can modify the code and values within the notebooks to experiment with the datasets and model parameters.




## Roadmap

- [x] Implement preprocessing pipeline
- [x] Build and test the neural network model
- [ ] Optimize the model to improve accuracy
- [ ] Expand the dataset for better generalization


## Contributing

Contributions make the open-source community an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
