## About The Project

League of Legends offers a complex battlefield where strategy and champion mastery play crucial roles in leading a team to victory. ChampNet dives deep into the strategy of this game, featuring two core functionalities:

1. **Champion Archetype Classification**: Utilizing neural networks, ChampNet classifies champions into Riot's six archetypes: Marksman, Mage, Tank, Assassin, Fighter, and Support. This classification provides valuable insights for team composition and strategic gameplay.

2. **Match Outcome Prediction**: The model extends its predictive capabilities to forecast match outcomes based on players' mastery scores of champions and other in-game metrics. By leveraging the power of XGBOOST, it analyzes which team, red or blue, has a higher chance of winning, aiding players in making informed decisions during champion selection

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

List of things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* Python
  ```sh
  python --version
  Python 3.8.5

### Installation

To set up ChampNet for use or development, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wburayu/ChampNet.git



## Usage

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ChampNet

3.Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

4. Open the .ipynb notebook files within the Jupyter interface in your browser.

Run the cells in the notebook to see the process in action. You can modify the code and values within the notebooks to experiment with the datasets and model parameters.




## Roadmap

- [x] Implement preprocessing pipeline
- [x] Build and test the neural network model
- [ ] Optimize the model to improve accuracy
- [ ] Expand the dataset for better generalization


## Contributing
