League of Legends Machine Learning Project
Question 1: Predicting Match Outcomes Based on Champion Mastery

Objective: To predict the likelihood of winning a League of Legends match using players' champion mastery.
Approach: Started with neural networks (70% accuracy), then shifted to XGBoosting with decision trees for better performance.
Outcome: Achieved 88% accuracy in predicting match outcomes using playerâ€™s mastery level and win rate on a champion. This model helps players decide whether to engage in a match, potentially affecting their rank.

Question 2: Predicting Champion Roles from Images

Objective: Determine a champion's role in League of Legends from their image.
Methodology: Used Riot's Data Dragon API for champion images, converting them into 2D RGB arrays. Implemented neural networks via Keras API, including convolutional layers to handle image data.
Results: Attained 26% accuracy in classifying champions into one of six roles, a significant achievement considering the large character pool (163 champions). This project highlights the potential for further improvement and real-world application of classroom learning.
